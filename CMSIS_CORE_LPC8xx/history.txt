History of updates to CMSIS_CORE_LPC8xx
=======================================

18 March 2013
-------------
Defines in system_LPC8xx.c changed so that clock setup is
done based on IRC rather than XTAL, so as to function with
LPC800-MAX board as well as LPCXpresso812. SystemCoreClock 
thus now defaults to 12MHz.

7 November 2012
---------------
CMSIS library project using ARM Cortex-M0+ CMSIS files as
supplied in ARM's CMSIS 3.01 March 2012 release, together
with device specific files.
